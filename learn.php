Today is 28-08-19
   = Gols for this week
	1. Create one ml project from Youtube
	2. Restart our website .......
	3. Gathering 10 Ideas which can be source of income 
	4. Create a Video for the youtube


............................................................

4. Start Python machine learing videos for the machine learing   on youtube.......
    
    and Create some General Questions and answers videos on
    the computer for the youtube....
So i have decided two things where i can use it to make youtube video with the help of these two videos......
	1. Tutorial point
	2. Android app which can be used to make the video..


======================================================

Top 10 Ideas == 
	1. Online learning webiste
	2. Create a blog website and write blogs about technology
	3. Create a website where people can get the interview questions.
	4. Create a website where people can create their resume free
	5. Create a website where ...


===========================================================

Today is the day when i will be posting my first video on machine learning.....

Today's topic.....
Challenges in ml
1. Quality of data...
2. Time-Consuming task.....( takes time to collect data and feature extraction and retrivel
3. Lack of specialist persons...
4. Issue of voerfitting and underfitting...(If the model is overfitting or under   fitting, it cannot be represented well for the problem....
5. Curse of dimensionality.....(ml model faces too many features of data points


Words which should be translated first....
	1. Dimensionality
	2. Deployment
	3. Overfittin and underfitting

Application of machine learning.....
1. Emotion Analysis
2...


Different Types of methods...
	1. Based on human supervision
	2. Unsupervised Learning
	3. Semi supervised Learning
	4. Reinforcement Learing


ML----
	1. Supervised Learning
		1.1 Regression
		1.2 Classification
	2. Unsupervised Learning
		1.1 Clustering
		1.2 Dimensionality Reduction
	3 Reinforcement Learning

1. Supervised Learning......
	use supervised learning when the output data is known. the algorithm will predict new data . Supervised learning as the name indicates the presence of a supervisor as a teacher. So basically teacher teach to the machine with some data and then machine is provided with a new set of data so that supervised learning algorithm analyses the training data

2. Unsupervised learning....
	Un supervised means no teacher is provided that means no training will be given to the machine. Therefore machine is restricted to find the hidden structure in unlabeled data by our-self.....
Example ... 
	Suppose it is given an image having both dogs and cats which have not seen ever. Thus the machine has no idea about the features of dogs and cats wo we can't categorize it in dogs and cats. 
But it can categorize them according to their similarities, patters and differences.....
.....
Clustering ( unsupervised learning)

3. Semi Supervised Learning.....
	Why to use semi-supervised learning....
	...
	Supervised learning need labeled and accruate data it cost high when you have large volume of data , To label the data we need data scientist to make accruate the data...
	and unsupervised learning data is that it's application spectrum is limited.....

Semi supervised learning is used when some amount of data is used to trained the  model and make cluster according to the data then use unsupervised learning to make usable unlabled data and cluster them.....

Intuitively, one may imagine the three types of learning algorithms as Supervised learning where a student is under the supervision of a teacher at both home and school, Unsupervised learning where a student has to figure out a concept himself and Semi-Supervised learning where a teacher teaches a few concepts in class and gives questions as homework which are based on similar concepts

Pratical Application of semi-supervised learning....
	Speech Analysis
	Internet Content Classification
	Protein Sequence Classification
